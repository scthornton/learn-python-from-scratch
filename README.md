# Python from Scratch: A Beginner's Tutorial

A comprehensive, interactive Jupyter notebook tutorial designed to teach Python programming to complete beginners with zero programming experience.

## Who This Is For

- **Complete beginners** who have never written code before
- **Non-developers** who want to learn programming fundamentals
- **Self-learners** who prefer hands-on, interactive tutorials
- **Anyone** who wants a solid foundation in Python basics

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial covers all Python fundamentals through 16 comprehensive sections:

### Core Concepts
- **Variables & Data Types** - Strings, integers, floats, booleans
- **Math Operations** - All arithmetic operators and practical calculations
- **Print Statements** - Displaying output and debugging

### Data Structures
- **Lists** - Creating, accessing, and manipulating ordered collections
- **Dictionaries** - Working with key-value pairs
- **Strings** - Text manipulation, formatting, and methods

### Control Flow
- **Conditionals** - if/elif/else statements and comparison operators
- **Loops** - for loops, while loops, and iteration
- **Functions** - Creating reusable code blocks

### Advanced Topics
- **File Operations** - Reading and writing files
- **JSON Handling** - Working with structured data
- **Error Handling** - try/except blocks for graceful error management
- **List Comprehensions** - Elegant, Pythonic list creation
- **API Requests** - Making HTTP requests with the requests library
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Building a complete TodoList application

## How to Use This Tutorial

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed on your computer
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scthornton/learn-python-from-scratch.git
   cd learn-python-from-scratch
   ```

2. **Install Jupyter (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

### Running the Tutorial

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the tutorial:**
   - Navigate to `python_basics_tutorial.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface
   - Click to open the notebook

3. **Work through the cells:**
   - Read each markdown cell for explanations
   - Run each code cell by clicking it and pressing **Shift + Enter**
   - **Type the code yourself** - don't copy/paste! This helps you learn
   - Complete the "Try it yourself" exercises throughout

### Learning Path

The tutorial is designed to be completed in order:

1. Start at the beginning - each section builds on previous concepts
2. Run every code cell to see outputs
3. Experiment with the code - modify values and see what happens
4. Complete all "Try it yourself" exercises
5. Build the final TodoList project to tie everything together

## Tutorial Structure

```
Section 1-3:   Fundamentals (print, variables, data types)
Section 4-6:   Data structures (math, lists, dictionaries)
Section 7-9:   Control flow (conditionals, loops, functions)
Section 10-13: Working with data (strings, files, JSON, errors)
Section 14-15: Advanced techniques (comprehensions, APIs)
Section 16:    Capstone project (Complete TodoList application)
```
